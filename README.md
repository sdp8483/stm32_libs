# stm32_libs
Collection of libraries and code for development of STM32 using STM32CubeIDE

## HAL Based Libraries
* [**HAL_eeprom_24LC02B**](/HAL/HAL_eeprom_24LC02B): library for interfacing with Microchip 24LC02B 2kb I2C EEPROM

## STM32 Platform Specific Peripheral Drivers
* [**stm32f4xx_drivers**](/Drivers/stm32f4xx_drivers): peripheral drivers for STM32F407xx microcontrollers. Based on Udemy course [Mastering Microcontrollers with Embedded Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/). Updated as I complete the courses. Currently working on GPIO, SPI, I2C, and UART/USART. Will port to other STM32 micros that I plan to use at a later time.
